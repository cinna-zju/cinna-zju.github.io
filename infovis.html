          <p>This is a visualization tool to help researchers deal with their data about a HCI experiment easily. The
            experiment is about how a user transist from menu to hotkey in order to select a command.</p>
          <p>This is the project of <i>Information Visualization</i>. I worked with Lemeng XU.</p>

      <h2 class="ui inverted header">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Emmanouil Giannisakis and Gilles Bailly, researchers at Sorbonne Universit√©, are studying how people transit
        from menu selection to keyboard shortcuts. They have a dataset about how users' behavior changes regarding
        performance
        and strategy choice while they selected commands.</p>
      <img class="ui image" src="img/infovis/intro.png" />

      <p>The goal of this visualization is to present the entire data set in a visual form so that they can observe and
        compare the data of each subject, and discover some common patterns.</p>

      <h2 class="ui inverted header">Design</h2>

      <p>We talked with Emmanouil and Gilles to know what the question is. They introduced the dataset to us
        and showed their past work. Then we found their main concern is about <b>TRANSITION</b>.</p>
      <p>Since there are about 20k rows of data, the concept of our design is to divide it, first by subjects, then by
        commands and finally by trials. Different information is displayed according to the different views.</p>
      <p>In the sketch phase, we used the <b>10 plus 10 method</b> to come up some ideas. Based on a common starting
        point, group members work individually to quickly sketch several ideas each, making around 10 ideas per group.
        They share the ideas within the group and choose one sketch as the starting point for the next round. </p>
      <p>The graphs in the first column are from the first phase. The other graphs are some variations.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="ten wide column">
      <p>Then we talked with them again about the first demo and our ideas. They liked it and wanted to see some
        high-level information. Then we add some new graphs and modified our design based on the first demo.</p>

    <div class="row">

        <h3 class="ui inverted header">Color map</h3>
        <p> we used the color map of red, yellow and purple to represent different phases of transitions. Grey means no
          transition. Vivid colors are clear on the grey background and can attract user's attention.</p>

      <h3 class="ui inverted header">Layout</h3>
      <p>The advantage of this layout is that researchers can compare the data of 42 subjects
        and go deep into the experimental data of each subject to seek subtle and interesting findings.

        <h3 class="ui inverted header">Interaction</h3>
        <p>We decided to develop this visualization on web because it can be highly customized.</p>
        <p>The interaction method is mouse and keyboard. Users can use mouse to select subjects and use keyboard to
          switch the subject they are viewing. Then we came up an idea to use the mouse cursor as an indicator showing
          the detail information.</p>
        <p>The cursor moves on the line chart. The corresponding grid will be highlighted and information will be
          displayed.</p>
